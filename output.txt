"11/11/2019 15:21",5,5,5,5,"I never learn anything about Tetris, This topic is really new for me. I need to pay more attention so that I can follow the presenter's topic. It is really very good topic for a beginner who interests at Tetris.","It seems like he knew a lot for Tetris. He is well organized for his topic. everything he said is step by step. He shows the codes to us and layouts. It is really good example for presenting for us also.","Things he was trying to show us is too hard for those who did not know Tetris before. I can not understand all the things he said. If he can make his presentation shorter, but more details for some of what he wanted to present is much better I think.",""
"11/11/2019 15:25",5,5,5,5,"I learned about the backend of how Tetris function. I used to play Tetris all the time so it was cool understanding how Tetris worked. He talked about droughts and floods. The use of randomized generator in Tetris was cool too. ","I liked how he went in depth on how Tetris works instead of talking about the history of Tetris. His showing of the various randomized generator algorithms enhanced his ideas very well. I also liked how he created a room for the class to join in and play Tetris. ","I think he did a very good job in his presentation. His presentation was very well research and he seemed very prepared. As a result, I do not have any comments that I think he should've done to make his presentation more effective. ",""
"11/11/2019 15:27",4,5,5,"","Tetris is really portable and can be written in almost any coding language and played on everything, each piece is called a tetromino. Definition of Flood and Drought as relating to tetris, Floods and droughts are detrimental to game health, had to find a way to code to avoid them. ","Popular game most people are familiar with, was fun to learn more about it, showing the coding and backend portion of tetris which most people have no knowledge of, showing how randomizer works and can be optimized. ","Possibly playing an older version of Tetris to show how common flood and drought was compared to a newer version using a different randomizer. Thats it. **************************************************","Good presentation! Learned alot about tetris!"
"11/11/2019 15:27",4,3,5,4,"It was really interesting to discover the logic behind the simple games. Which it only consist the 5 characters in side the array, and just set the randomizer to pick out the different character each time. also check if the chosen one is the same as the previous one, this will ensure no same piece was chosen in a row. ","A lot of useful information was presented. Easy for us to understand the logic behind the design. Well thought out and explanation. The game chat and online game room was great, it was a great user interaction. ","Talks too fast, maybe slow down a bit and do not feed all the informations all at once. I felt I got too much information all at once. Maybe explain more about the game and more on the coding process should be great. ",""
"11/11/2019 15:27",5,5,5,5,"I learned the history of Tetris, it was created in soviet union and was the first game distributed in united states that was made in soviet union, it was created by Alexey Pajitnov. I learned that each piece is called Tetromino which is a geometric shape made of four squares, and the objective is to fill the board so the pieces disappear and not reach the top. I learned algorithims and functions that generated the next piece that was thrown to the user, in different years through out Tetris history the algorithm improved to generate next pieces.","The presenter gave a brief history of Tetris and gave us the rules of the game. He also then showed us how the pieces were generated and showed us the algorithms and codes that each version of tetris utilized to generate next piece. The presenter also gave a interactive presentation in which we were able play and test out Tetris.","The presenter did the whole presentation pretty well and gave enough information to understand the game and why there were iterations of algorithms in each version of tetris. They gave an interactive game of tetris that we could tried out. ",""
"11/11/2019 15:27",5,5,5,5,"I learned a lot more about Tetris than I knew. I learned about floods and droughts, and the piece generator algorithm. I liked learning about the algorithm specifically. It was nice seeing some of the concepts we learned in class be put into use.","The presenter was very well informed about his topic. He spoke clearly and didn't just stand at the podium the entire time. There was good tone of voice and it was very well explained. The slides were also very well organized. There was also a good amount of humor. I really liked the game.","There isn't a lot to say. The presentation was very good. I guess one thing I can think of is maybe face the audience a lot more. If the presenter did that instead of looking to the right for a lot of the time, it would help. But it wasn't really a big problem. The presentation was still really good. ","Great job!"
"11/11/2019 15:28",5,5,5,5,"I learned that Tetris was created in Soviet Russia. I think that's a pretty cool fact that I never knew. I also learned about flood and droughts for the pieces that come down on the screen and how it was created in code.","The presenter wasn't reading from the slides and was just talking. The slides only had important and relevant but short information so the slides weren't cluttered. I think the combination of this makes a good presentation as it makes it a lot more personal.","I think the presentation was great! I think the presentation was great!

"11/11/2019 15:28",5,5,5,5,"I learned the brief history of Tetris, it was created in the soviet union in 1985 by Alexey Pajitnov. This game is very universal and can be played on any platform or device. I learned that each piece is called a tetromino. A flood is the sequence of the same piece, so if we received the same piece in a row more than once. The opposite of a flood is a drought, in which the sequence is omitting a certain piece.","I liked that he explained the basics of the game for people who have not played or heard of this game before. He also explained some vocabulary of the game to further his presentation and explain the code of the different versions of Tetris. It was really cool that he added a game time at the end of his presentation which allowed the whole class to play versing each other.","His presentation was very organized and he explained the difference between each version, which I never knew that there were different versions. Each version was different in that some had floods and droughts and others tried to get rid of floods and droughts. His presentation was very informative but fairly long, explaining a lot of things that people already know such as the controls of how to play. ",""
"11/11/2019 15:31",5,5,5,5,"Learned how much the tetris algorithm has changed over time and why it has changed. The algorithm changed in order to better implement what pieces come and make it less random eventually making the game more enjoyable. ","The presenter had a colorful presentation which also included a way to play the game with everyone which was very interesting and an interesting change from all the other presentations so I thought that was very fun.","The presentation was very entertaining but only went through the surface level of how tetris works but is the presentation could've also included more in depth facts then that could've helped out with the overall presentation.",""
"11/11/2019 15:46",5,5,5,5,"Tetromino is a geometric shape composed of 4 squares. The old version of the game only has 1 piece history with 1 roll. In 2001, there is 7 piece bag. Flood is sequence of the same piece. He also introduced the controls of the game, and also test the game.","He demonstrated how to play the game. He shows the implement of the code of the game, and explains each line of the code. It is easy to understand how to play the game. And he also let everyone join the game.","He could give more background or history of the game. This is a pity because the introduction was very engaging. He could add a outline to his presentation.

"11/11/2019 16:01",5,5,5,5,"From the presenter's presentation, I learned more about tetris, including the background and the main functions of ramdomizing the output of tetris. I had played tetris for many years but i never noticed that all forms of tetris were composed by 4 squares. Also, I didn't know that there were multiple changes on how to implement the randomized output.","The presenter chose a good and interesting topic, at least for me it is. The presenter also did well in the way he used combination of real codes for the implementation of the functions within the topic. That matches the class theme also: computer science.","I think the presenter had explained his topic really well. The only thing I will suggest it that the last part, which was playing the game, I think it would be better to just give the link to the audience and let them try on their own, instead of holding a game in the presentation.",""

Additionally what worked well was the structure of the presentation and how it was thorough yet organized.","What would make this presentation more effective might be talking about the technological aspect more.

Another factor that work well with this presentation was that he got the whole class to be able to play teteris. That was pretty fun to do.
